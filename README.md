# Responsive Auto Website Project
A responsive auto website landing page, created using HTML and CSS. 
The goal for this project is to practice my HTML and CSS skills, looking to improve and learn new things as the project develops.
A future goal that I set myself in the future is to come back to this project in order to incorporate what I learn about javascript, to improve even more the user experience
